Permissible Use. Unless you are a real estate or lending professional acting in your professional capacity, you agree to use the Services for your personal use, and your commercial use is limited to transactions done on your own behalf. The commercial use of real estate and lending professionals is limited to providing information to consumers via the Services or, where authorized, taking actions on behalf of a consumer client (e.g., post a home for sale). Without limitation, lending professionals and institutions are prohibited from using information provided by Zillow Group through the Services in making any loan-related decisions. The Services may be used only for transactions in residential real estate and may not be used for transactions in commercial real estate, which includes, without limitation, commercially zoned properties, timeshares, and vacation rentals. Subject to the restrictions set forth in the following paragraphs, you may copy information from the Services only as necessary for your personal use to view, save, print, fax and/or e-mail such information. You agree otherwise not to reproduce, modify, distribute, display or otherwise provide access to, create derivative works from, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any portion of the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate level data provided on the Zillow Local-Info Pages, and available at http://www.zillowblog.com/research/, (the “Aggregate Data”) may be used for non-personal uses, e.g., real estate market analysis. You may display and distribute derivative works of the Aggregate Data (e.g., within a graph), so long as Zillow Group is cited as a source.
Restrictions and Additional Terms. You agree not to remove or modify any copyright or other intellectual property notices that appear in the Services. You will not use the Services for resale, service bureau, time-sharing or other similar purposes. Further:
Acceptable Use. You agree not to use the Services in any way that is unlawful, or harms Zillow Group, its service providers, suppliers or any other user.

You agree not to distribute or post spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or similar communications through the Services. You agree not to impersonate another person or misrepresent your affiliation with another person or entity.

Zillow Mortgages.

Lenders may elect to respond to consumer requests with non-binding customized quotes of the terms they would offer to a borrower fitting the consumer's anonymous profile, as well as their contact information. These non-binding quotes are not intended to be Good Faith Estimates as defined in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Zillow Group also allows consumers to request that Lenders pre-approve them for home loans. When consumers submit the required information and request pre-approval from a participating Lender, Lenders may elect to respond based on parameters established by the Lender. Qualification for pre-approval does not constitute an offer to lend, a commitment for a loan, or a guarantee of specific rates or terms. If you, as a consumer, choose to contact a Lender through Zillow Mortgages by filling out a contact request or other request form on Zillow Mortgages, you authorize Zillow Group to provide your name and contact information  and other identifying information you provide to the Lender you choose, along with your quote or pre-approval request.  You acknowledge that, by submitting your contact request or other request form on the Services, you may receive telemarketing calls from or on behalf of the Lender you choose at the telephone number(s) you provide. By submitting your name, contact information and other identifying information, your identity will no longer be anonymous. Any loan or other business conducted is between you and the Lender.
The Role of Zillow Group; Disclaimer. Zillow Group is not a Lender, mortgage broker, loan originator, loan processor, or  underwriter. Zillow Group does not aid or assist borrowers in obtaining loans, solicit borrowers or Lenders for loans, offer or negotiate terms of loans, or make loans or credit decisions in connection with loans.

Zillow Group is not an agent of either any consumer or any Lender. Zillow Group is only providing an administrative service to consumers and participating Lenders. Decisions regarding pre-approval requests are made by participating Lenders and not Zillow Group.
